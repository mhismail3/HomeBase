After learning core HTML/CSS and the basics of JavaScript, I redesigned my personal site into a single, succinct landing page that reveals content as you scroll.

<figure class="pin pin-left">
  <img src="/portfolio/personal-website/personal-website-animation-example.gif" alt="Animation example" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
</figure>

Waypoints trigger small animations via jQuery helpers and Animate.css, keeping the experience lively without overwhelming the content.
