I designed a dark theme for the Brackets text editor with a colorful but restrained palette. The theme is written in Less and focuses on readable contrasts across common language tokens.

<figure class="pin pin-right">
  <img src="/portfolio/introversed-brackets/ibtheme-colors.png" alt="Theme colors" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
</figure>

As of 2017, the theme had 18,000+ downloads in the Brackets extension registry.
