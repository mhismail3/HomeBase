My first foray into web development began with me learning on Udemy how to structure web content in HTML and style it with basic CSS, and ended with me developing a basic portfolio theme, written from scratch. I used this very theme for my own basic portfolio website for a couple of months as well.

After deciding to redesign my own site, I repurposed this theme into a standalone template that can be used by anyone who wants a hassle-free, responsive HTML/CSS website for themselves.

You can find this theme on my GitHub page.
