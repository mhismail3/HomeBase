The goal of this project was to recreate the original Space Invaders arcade game as faithfully as possible while applying common design patterns to keep the code efficient and extensible.

The game runs atop Azul, a graphics and rendering framework used in class. I implemented the rest from scratch to match the original game’s behaviors.

I used a number of patterns to keep complexity in check (factories, observers, command objects, etc.). A brief design document is available <a href="/portfolio/space-invaders/SpaceInvaders_DesignDocument.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
